Note-taking apps are the online equivalent of notebooks, and because they're digital, they can do more for you than paper ever could. 
Most can store your notes in the cloud and sync them across multiple devices. Note-taking apps also include text search, so in a matter
of seconds, you can find whatever notes you need. The best note-taking apps also let you snap pictures,
upload files, record audio, and clip pages from the web.
